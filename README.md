#Multiples of 3 and 5

##Challenge 1

    From Project Euler Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Clone this project, write the body of the function **sumOfAMultiple** so that the jasmine tests pass.
The function will return the sum of all the multiples of **3** or **5** below **n**.

There are **4** tests, once your tests pass, uncomment the last two and fill in the correct result.

(you'll need jasmine-node)  
    npm install jasmine-node -g

run automated tests by running  
    jasmine-node --autotest .
